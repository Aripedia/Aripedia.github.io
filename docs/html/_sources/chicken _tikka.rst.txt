Slow Cooker Chicken Tikka Masala
=================================

* Serves 4 to 6

..*Notes*

* Based on feedback from users who have made this recipe, we have retested and tweaked it, starting with saut√©eing the onion, garlic, and aromatics to really develop the deep flavors that are the hallmark of tikka masala. There is also now a spice blend of garam masala, coriander, cumin, and turmeric, and we've increased the amount of chicken to feed more people.

* Draining the tomatoes also helps to reduce the amount of liquid that form the basis of the sauce, and simmering the final sauce uncovered with the cream or coconut milk helps to thicken it. I've really enjoyed this with rice or even some naan for dipping!

Ingredients:
------------

* 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1/2 cup whole-milk plain yogurt (not Greek)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
* 1 large yellow onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger
* 2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 2 teaspoons garam masala
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
* 3/4 cup heavy cream or coconut milk
* Chopped fresh cilantro
* Cooked rice or naan, for serving


Instructions:
-------------

* Place the chicken, yogurt, and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a 4-quart or larger slow cooker and stir to combine.
* Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, coriander, garam masala, cumin, and turmeric and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook until darkened in color, about 1 minute. Add the drained tomatoes and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and bring to a simmer, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Transfer to the slow cooker and stir to combine with the chicken.
* Cover and cook on the HIGH setting for 4 hours or LOW setting for 8 hours. Stir in the cream or coconut milk. If you prefer a thicker sauce, leave the slow cooker uncovered and cook on the HIGH setting for 30 minutes. Taste and season with salt as needed. Serve garnished with cilantro with rice or naan.

..*Notes*

* Using chicken breasts: Chicken breasts can be substituted for the thighs, although I find thighs hold up better over the long cooking and breasts tend to fall into shreds. Still delicious, though!
* Smoky flavor alternative: For a little of that smoky tandoori flavor, try using smoked paprika and roasted tomatoes.
* Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months.
