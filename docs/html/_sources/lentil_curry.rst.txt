SLOW_COOKER_COCONUT_LENTIL_CURRY
================================

* Save the Coconut Milk for Last for a Richer Flavor
* Here's what you need to know about this slow cooker curry: It's an extraordinarily easy recipe that relies on simple pantry ingredients and a couple of spices, yet delivers a deep, bold flavor at the end of the day. While you could technically pour the coconut milk into the slow cooker with the other ingredients at the beginning, the long cook time has a way of dulling the flavor and creamy richness. Instead, stir it in at the very end of cooking to take full advantage of the flavor and creaminess.
