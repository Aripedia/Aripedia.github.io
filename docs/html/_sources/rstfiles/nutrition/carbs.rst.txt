Carbohydrates
=============

* "hydrated carbon" = carbon with water
* they are eaten and digested, and than converted to glucose which is the main human fuel.
* 3 main types:
   * simple - monosaccharides (gluose, fructose, galactose-in milk)
   * double - disaccharides (lactose, sucrose)
   * complex - polysaccharides (cellulose, starch)


Functions in the body 
---------------------

 * they are eaten, digested and converted to a sugar called glucose
 * Glucose is the main source of energz for your body cells. Some glucose is used right away, some is stored as glycogen and the leftover glucose is converted to fat. When the body needs more energy, it convets stored glycogen back to glucose to be used in the cells
