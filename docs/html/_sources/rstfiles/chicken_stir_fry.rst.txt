Instructions:
--------------

#. Heat wok over high heat for about 1 minute (see note). Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl it around the wok to coat the entire cooking surface and heat for 30-60 seconds or until very hot. Add half the chicken strips and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes or until the chicken is sealed and just cooked through (see note). Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside. Add about half the remaining peanut oil to the wok and repeat the process with the remaining chicken strips.
#. Add the remaining oil to the wok and heat over high heat until hot. Add the onion and capsicum and stir-fry for 2 minutes (see note).
#. Add the mushrooms and broccolini and stir-fry for a further 2 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic and chillies. Season with salt and stir-fry for 1 minute or until aromatic (see note).
#. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce and water and toss for about 1 minute. Return the chicken to the wok and stir until the vegetables and chicken are coated with the sauces and the vegetables are tender crisp.
#. Remove the wok from the heat, toss through the bean sprouts and coriander and serve the stir-fry immediately with cooked rice or noodles.
