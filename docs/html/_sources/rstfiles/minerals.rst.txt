Minerals and trace elements
============================

* Minerals, like vitamins, are chemicals the human body needs to function properly, but unlike vitamins, minerals come entirely from the earth and always retain their chemical identity. This means that from the time a mineral is ingested into the body, to the time it is excreted, it is never changed into anything else. 
* There are two types of minerals:
   * major minerals
   * trace minerals

Major minerals
--------------

* Major minerals are required in higher amounts in the body. The seven major minerals are: 
   * Calcium
   * Sodium
   * Phosphorus
   * Chloride
   * Potassium
   * Magnesium 
   * Sulfur

Trace minerals
--------------

* Trace minerals are found in smaller amounts in the body. They amount to less than a teaspoon of a person’s body weight. The nine trace minerals are: 
   * Iron
   * Manganese
   * Zinc 
   * Chromium 
   * Copper 
   * Molybdenum
   * Iodine
   * Flourine
   * Selenium

Calcium
~~~~~~~~

* Function: 
   * Streghtens bones and teeth. Regulates heartbeat and helps with muscle and nerve function.
* Sources: 
   * milk, dairy products, dark green leafy vegetables, salmon, sardines, turnips, tofu, almond, broccoli, chia seeds, sunflower seeds
* Deficiency:
   * minor deficiency can effect bone and teeth formations

Iodine
~~~~~~~

* Function:
   * keeps the thyroid gland working. The thyroid gland helps regulate the rate at which your body carries out necessary physiological functions (metabolism)
* Sources: 
   * seafood, seeweed, dairy products, iodised salt
* Deficiency:
   * Enlargement of the thyroid gland (what affects metabolism)

Iron
~~~~~

* Function:
   * Helps the blood and muscles carry oxygen to the body. It is also part of some enzymes.
* Sources: 
   * liver, red meat, egg yolk, legumes, wholegrains, dark green vegetables
* Deficiency:
   * Anemia - tiredness and lethargy, feelings of weakness, insomnia and palpitations.

Magnesium
~~~~~~~~~~

* Function: 
   * Helps muscle work, aids metabolism and aids in bone growth
* Sources: 
   * whole grains, nuts (cashew, almond, brazil nuts), legumes, apricots, bananas, soy, beans, green leafy vegetables, avocado, seeds (flax,pumpkin, chia), fatty fish
* Deficiency:
   * fatigue, numbness, poor memory, muscle twitching and irritability, tingling and rapid heart beat

Potassium
~~~~~~~~~~

* Function:
   * essential for nerve function, muscle contraction and maintenance of fluid and blood pressure in the body
* Sources: 
   * oranges, bananas, peanuts, white beans, sweet potatoe, white potatoe, mushroom, peas, cucumber, spinach, beets
* Deficiency:
   * depression, fatigue, hypertension, decreased heart rate

Selenium
~~~~~~~~~

* Function:
   * Helps to prevent damage to cells and aids in the functioning of the thyroid gland.
* Sources:
   * tuna, brazil nuts, eggs, grains, meat, poultry, shellfish, fish
* Deficiency:
   * poor heart function, osteoarthropathy, mental retardation

Zinc
~~~~~

* Function:
   * helps wounds to heal. Aids taste and smell sensory.
* Sources:
   * wholewheat, peanut, poultry, legumes, beef, shellfish, seeds, nuts, avocado
* Deficiency:
   * growth retardation, hair loss, diarrhoea, delayed sexual maturation and impotence, eye and skin lesions and loss of apetite

Absorption of minerals
-----------------------

.. todo:: do some research on this topic

* For minerals to be absorbed properly, the digestive system needs to be in good working order.
* Good stomach acid levels are needed to help separate the mineral from food or supplement. Low HCL (stomach acid) can inhibit the breakdown on the stomach.
* The body controls mineral absorption via the intestinal wall depending on the needs and requirements.
* Over-loading the body can result in toxicity.
* Foods rich in Phytatescan block absorption (fibre-containing whole grain products –beans, seeds, nuts and soy foods).
* Foods rich in Oxalates can hinder absorption also (rhubarb, beets, spinach, sweet potatoes, tea, chocolate and soy products).
* Some Vitamins and Minerals improve absorption. Vitamin D can assist with the absorption of Calcium and Magnesium. Vitamin C can assist the absorption of Iron.
