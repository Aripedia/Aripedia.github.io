Ingredients:
------------

* 200g coconut butter, softened  
* 1/4 cup extra virgin coconut oil, softened (55 g)
* 1-2 tbsp organic lemon zest or lemon extract (1-2 tsp) - it depends on your palate
* 15-20 drops Stevia extract (Clear or Lemon)
* optional: pinch sea salt or pink Himalayan salt

.. note::

   Based on some feedback, 2-4 tbsp powdered Erythritol works better than stevia - the amount depends on your preference. Coconut butter is also known as "creamed coconut" - this is not the same as coconut milk "creamed" in the fridge. You can also use shredded coconut to make coconut butter in a food processor.

Instructions:
-------------

* Zest the lemons and make sure the coconut butter and coconut oil are softened (room temperature). It's better if you use a very fine grater to avoid having large pieces of lemon peel in the fat bombs.
* Mix all the ingredients in a bowl and make sure the lemon zest and stevia are distributed evenly. You can use clear, lemon or coconut stevia drops.
   * If you prefer a sweeter and less bitter taste (may be caused by too much stevia), use 2-4 tablespoons or powdered Erythritol instead.
* Fill each mini muffin paper cup, or silicone candy mold with ~ 1 tbsp of the coconut mixture and place on a tray that will fit in the fridge.
* Place in the fridge for 30-60 minutes or until solid.
* When done, keep refrigerated. Coconut oil and coconut butter get soft at room temperature. Enjoy!
