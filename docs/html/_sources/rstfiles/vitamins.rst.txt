Vitamins
========

* Vitamins are compounds we have to get from food that are essential for normal physiologic processes in the body.
* We get vitamins from food in very small amounts. Vitamins are very important and help almost every chemical reaction in our bodies. 
* There are various examples of how our body needs vitamins.
   * Vitamin C is used to make collagen, a protein that gives your skin both strength and elasticity.
   * Without Vitamin K your blood  doesn’t clot and a nosebleed  could mean life or death. 
   * We can’t make red blood cells without Vitamin B12. 
* Keep in mind, vitamins, minerals, and fibers do not add to muscle strength, supply energy, or cure diseases; though they are very important.
