Proteins
========

* made up of carbons, hydrogen and oxygen, but they also contain nitrogen
* each protein is made of amino acids which form a long chain called polypeptide which make up proteins. 
* we use about 20 different amino acids, and arrange them into thousands of proteins 
* each protein is organ specific, which mean the protein your skin needs is different form what your lungs or heart needs. 11 you can make in your body, but the others you have to have delivered - by eating. 



Functions of proteins
----------------------

* Primary fucntion: 
   * Proteins are used for growth and repair of body tissues and cells
* Enzymatic function:
   * All enzymes are actually proteins. Enzymes are chemicals that speed up the chemical reactions, such as digestion in the body. Enzymes are needed for this process to accure efficiently. They also pay an important role when it comes to metabolism. 
* Transport function:
   * They act as carriers for the nutrients (e. haemoglobin carries oxygen).
* Hormonal function:
   * Some hormones are made from proteins (growth hormone, insulin - produced by our pancreas in responce to ingestion of our carbs)
* Immune function:
   * antibodies - fight off the illnes
* Buffering function: 
   * Maintain ph balance of the blood (ph has to be kept in a very narrow range)

* Proteins forms the structure of the soft tissues (such as skin and muscles) and hard tissues (such as bones and teeth) that make up most part of the body. All these tissues are constantly being produced.
* Proteins control fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance in the body. 
* Proteins also provide some energy

Protein requirements:
----------------------

* 0.75 (1) x kg of body weight - for general population

Food sources:
--------------

* animal sources have the highest concentration of proteins
* eggs
* seafood/fish - also high in omega-3 fatty acids
* cheese
* beans - also high in fiber
* almonds

Excess intake
-------------

* When more protein is eaten then required, the amino acids that make up the protein molecule are deaminated; meaning the nitrogen-containing amine group is separated.
* Deamination produces ammonia, which the cells release into the blood stream. The liver then takes this up.
* Liver cells convert the ammonia to urea and release this into the blood to be filtered out by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. The carbon section that remains can be converted to energy if required, or stored as fat
