Lipids/fats
===========

* Lipids, or fats, are one of the nutrient groups vital to the human body. 
* A lipid is a naturally occurring chemical compound that cannot be dissolved in water. 
* Lipids perform several necessary functions for the body.  
* 3 main types types:
   * triglycerides (glycerolipids)
   * phospholipids (protecting and insulating our cells)
   * sterols (cholesterol - produced by body + consumed by food. It does play role in producing hormones - estogen, testostreon. 

* Triglycerides, the fat most familiar as body fat and the fat in food. Each triglyceride is a compound that is made up of glycerol, which is an alcohol and fatty acids.
* A fatty acid is an organic compound linking a fatty chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms on one end to an acid group at the other end.
* Triglycerides include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats known as the good fats.
* Triglycerides serve several purposes including to supply energy, protect against temperature extremes and shock, and to help the body use carbohydrates and protein efficiently.
* Saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol are the bad fats found in many food products and are the ones to be careful of eating because of the health risks they can cause including heart disease and obesity. 
* There are two kinds of good fats: monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat.
* Monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat are known to have the benefit of lowering blood cholesterol level and combating other associated negative outcomes of bad fats.

Functions in the body 
---------------------

* Fats are a very concentrated source of energy and are the form in which energy is stored in the body. Fats provide more than twice the energy of carbohydrates and protein.
* Fats provide the essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic). These essential fatty acids assist in the absorption and transport of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E. 
* Fats also give the body its shape and insulates the body, assisting in the maintenance of body temperature.
* Lipids carry fat soluble vitamins - A, D, E, K + antioxidants
