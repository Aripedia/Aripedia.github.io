Instructions:
-------------

* Lamb
   #. Set the oven to 180C/350F then start making the lamb layer.
   #. Fry the diced onion in the olive oil. Add the garlic and cook until the onion is clear.
   #. Add the lamb and continue to cook until all the meat is slightly browned.
   #. Add the tomatoes and spices, then cook on a low heat for 15 minutes while you make the other layers.
* Eggplant/Aubergine
   #. Slice the eggplants/aubergines into 1-2cm slices. Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a frying pan, and fry the slices until golden on both sides.
   #. As the eggplant slices are fried, place them in a single layer on the bottom of the baking pan. Keep half the slices for another layer once we assemble the moussaka.
* Bechamel Sauce
   #. In a measuring jug, put the yogurt, crumbled feta and egg yolks. Whisk together with a fork.
* To Assemble The Moussaka
   #. Place the lamb mixture onto the baking dish that already has half the eggplant slices lining the bottom.
   #. Place the remaining eggplant slices, then pour the b√©chamel sauce over the entire dish.
   #. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese if you like.
   #. Bake at 180C/350F for 20 minutes.
