* Ease of Preparation: Moderate
* Prep Time: 15 Minutes
* Cooking Time: 30 Minutes
* Total Time: 45 Minutes

Ingredients:
------------

* 680 g Raw Pork Belly
* 3 Large Eggs
* 1 Medium Head of Cauliflower
* 3-4 Green Onions
* 1/4 Large Red Onion
* 1 TBSP Fresh Ginger
* 6 Cloves Fresh Garlic
* 1 Teaspoon Huy Fong Garlic Chili Sauce
* 2 TBSP Bragg Liquid Aminos
* 3 TBSP Chosen Foods Avocado Oil
* 1 TBSP Chosen Foods Toasted Sesame Oil
* 1/2 Teaspoon Black Pepper

Instructions:
-------------

#. Slice the Pork Belly into strips that are about 1/2 Inch thick and set aside in a bowl.
#. Dice the Red Onion, Garlic, and Ginger and set aside for later.
#. Chop up the head of Cauliflower, and separate into smaller chunks, discarding the stems.
#. Place the Cauliflower into your Food Processor and pulse to chop it up into small rice-sized chunks. Donâ€™t add too much at one time, it will be easier to manage if you separate the cauliflower into 3-4 smaller batches when ricing it in the Food Processor. Set the Cauliflower Rice aside for later.
#. Heat up the Wok to about 400#.F and add in about 1 TBSP of the Avocado Oil. When the oil is nice and hot add in the Cauliflower Rice and cook for about 5 minutes to get it approximately halfway cooked, and then empty it back into a bowl for later.
#. Put the Wok back on the stove and add another TBSP of the Avocado Oil, and then place the Pork Belly into the wok to begin cooking it. You will need to cook it for about 10 minutes to render some of the fat from it, and to get it cooked most of the way through. Season with Blakc Pepper. Remove the Pork Belly from the Wok, but retain the grease in the Wok for the next step.
#. Whisk your 3 eggs together in a Small Bowl and pour into the Wok to flash fry. When eggs are about half-way cooked begin to break them up with a spoon and then remove them from the Wok and set aside once they are fully cooked (but not overly cooked).
#. Now we are going to start the finally assembly and cooking stages for this dish so we will add the remaining Avocado Oil to the Wok and then turn the temperature down to about 375#.F, and then add in the minced Ginger and Garlic and begin to brown them. After about 1 minute add in the Red Onion and 1 TBSP of the Bragg Liquid Aminos and cook that until about transparent.
#. Add the Pork Belly back into the Wok and stir in with the Garlic etc. Add the other 1 TBSP of Bragg Liquid Aminos, 1 Teaspoon of Garlic Chili Sauce and cook for about 5 minutes.
#. Add the Chopped Green Onion to the dish.
#. Add the Cauliflower Rice back in and pour in the 1 TBSP of Sesame Oil for flavoring and begin to stir all of the ingredients together while cooking for about 5 more minutes.
#. Add the Scrambled Eggs back in and continue stirring and combining the ingredients while heating it all back up to your desired level of doneness (probably just a few more minutes at this point)
#. Serve right away, or store in an air-tight container for up to a 3 days in the refrigerator.
